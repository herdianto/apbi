To run the setup:

```
npm install
npm start (or npm run build)
```

Once the bundling is complete, the app will automatically run in a new tab in your browser. Feel free to edit any JS or SCSS file in `app/components`, as this will trigger a new round of linting, unit tests, and hot reloading in the browser.
